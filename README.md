Hi there 👋, I'm Jad, a science and tech enthusiast based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. On my free time, I enjoy contributing to open source projects, going on hikes, working out, watching movies and TV shows, and playing video games.

I am currently working on [arrow 🏹](https://github.com/arrow-py/arrow), [sec-edgar-downloader 📈](https://github.com/jadchaar/sec-edgar-downloader), [sec-cik-mapper🗺](https://github.com/jadchaar/sec-edgar-downloader), and [sec-edgar-api 🤖](https://github.com/jadchaar/sec-edgar-api).
